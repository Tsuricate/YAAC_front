## API

This project relies on back-end project: https://github.com/Tsuricate/YAAC_back

but API is already hosted at https://yaac-back.vercel.app, so you don't need to host it yourself.

## Notes

This project is a POC (Proof Of Concept) but it's fully usable and stable.

However, due to performance issues, a refactor is planned using Redux for better state management.
